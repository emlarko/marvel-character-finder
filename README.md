# MARVEL CHARACTER FINDER

## Description

- It was great experince to be part of this project.
- User able to search their own favorite charcter to find related information such as charcter description , comics ,movie and movie details.
As a process we use two different API to gather all information.
One of the Api is Marvel Api where we get Marvel charcter information and comics and other api is OMDB Api where we get movie information.
- We had couple of challenge to complate our Marvel website.One of them was to set modal to remind user to search Marvel character if they attend to search non-Marvel charcter and take them back to the home page.
- We learn about different styling metarials , using and combine two different APIs.
